#### Libraries
 > threading: pip install threading

#### What is it?
 > Python-based replication of the simulations made by Joshi et al. (2017).
 > It is an evolutionary-dynamics model to explore the coevolution of cooperation and cohesion in populations with fission-fusion dynamics
 > It uses matrix-based calculations for positions and velocities for a flocking-algorithm
 > It runs for several generations, and records data from each
 > It reduces computing time by not having animations
